# Classification of Mice Based on Protein Expression Levels**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying mice based on their protein expression levels using machine learning models. By analyzing a multivariate dataset, the goal is to uncover patterns in protein expression and predict the category of mice with high accuracy.

## Motivation  
Protein expression is crucial in understanding biological processes, and classifying subjects based on these levels can provide insights into genetic or health-related patterns. This project applies data science techniques to solve a biologically relevant problem, showcasing the potential of machine learning in life sciences.

 
- Features: Includes protein expression levels as numerical features and the classification labels as the target variable.  
- Note: Due to data sensitivity, raw data is not included in this repository. You can simulate similar data using the provided scripts.

## Technical Approach  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values using [technique, e.g., mean imputation].  
- Normalized protein expression levels to ensure consistent scaling across features.  
- Visualized feature relationships using heatmaps and pairplots.  

### 2. Model Training  
- Models used: [e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine].  
- Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Trained and tested models on an 80-20 split of the dataset.  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.  
- Achieved [accuracy, e.g., 92%] on the test set.  

### 4. Visualizations  
- Heatmap of feature correlations.  
- Confusion Matrix for model performance.  
- Feature importance plot (if applicable).  

## Key Results  
- Best-performing model: [e.g., Random Forest].  
- High accuracy achieved in distinguishing mouse categories.  
- Visualizations revealed significant features influencing the classification.
